### Announcements from Visa and Mastercard signal the growing role of AI assistants in online shopping.

- Visa's [Intelligent Commerce](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng7ZOxVIT5GtnZQMVfbVW34/K_nL9qZppXVy) offers a safe way for AI to complete payments.
- Early partners include OpenAI and Anthropic, among other top AI labs, which makes it likely that ChatGPT and Claude will soon be completing checkouts for us.
- Similarly, Mastercard's [Agent Pay](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng9SOU0bReVLpvkAg26IFza/YamnM-Lv1BX0) will allow you to complete purchases without leaving apps like ChatGPT when they list products.

#### Nutt's Notes

It's no coincidence that these announcements come alongside ChatGPT's new shopping features. As AI labs seek to monetize their capital-intensive services, ecommerce presents a ripe opportunity.

---

### ChatGPT got better for shopping and citing.

OpenAI [added a handful of improvements](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng5gPQzzUW2RlD6YLJ6im6Y/fvieTbWqsAED) to ChatGPT search:

1. A new product-results interface offers recommendations, comparisons, and direct purchase links.
2. A 'highlight' feature attributes specific segments of the response to their source.
3. As you type, you'll see trending searches and autocomplete suggestions.
4. You can search from WhatsApp by messaging 1-800-ChatGPT.

#### Nutt's Notes

- As I say often, ChatGPT offers the best blend of capabilities and features. These updates make that more true.
- It was Perplexity that first put the heat on Google Search. Now, it seems, ChatGPT is overtaking them both.

### AI Mode for Google Search is rolling out to everyone in the US.

To no one's surprise, Google's I/O conference was all about AI. Here are the two announcements most notable to everyday users like yourself:

**AI Mode for Search**—widely understood to be the future of Google Search—is currently rolling out to all US users.
   - Moving beyond the blue link list, AI Mode provides comprehensive, synthesized answers to complex queries by breaking them down into subtopics and searching them simultaneously.
   - Future planned capabilities include:
     - Deep Search for expert-level reports
     - Search Live for real-time visual search through the camera
     - Agentic capabilities to help users complete tasks like booking tickets
   - When it's enabled for you, you'll find it in a dedicated tab on Google's homepage.

Secondly, **Gmail's Smart Replies** are gaining access to past emails to sound more like you and provide common responses to similar emails.
   - It'll also have access to Google Drive for additional context.
   - Access will begin in Google Labs, then extend to Google Workspace and Google One subscribers, likely in Q3.

### Sam Altman and Jony Ive are joining forces on AI hardware.

- OpenAI is acquiring io, a startup by legendary Apple designer Jony Ive, for nearly $6.5 billion.
- Best known for designing the iPhone, Ive is bringing a crack team of 55 employees, many of whom are ex-Apple designers or engineers.
- That's the alchemy for AI's "iPhone moment," with revolutionary AI-native hardware slated to begin rolling out in 2026.
- Ive’s design firm, LoveFrom, will also help shape the look and feel of OpenAI’s software, including ChatGPT.

### Notion redefined productivity—again—with new AI features.

With four powerful new AI features, Notion continues its tradition of centralizing resources to create a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts.

1. **Meeting notes** is a new type of block that transcribes your meeting and generates summaries, action items and other useful takeaways. You can also chat with Notion AI to ask questions about a specific meeting or all meetings.
   - Add it like any other block using `/`.
   - It uses your system audio, so it works with any virtual meeting app or IRL.
   - If you use Notion Calendar, event notifications will include the option to create a page for AI meeting notes.

2. **Enterprise search** allows you to search across all your tools and services, including your Notion workspace, cloud drives, email and Slack.
   - From the homepage, you can connect services.
   - For each search, you can search across all services or specify one.
   - Searches that include your Notion workspace include the contents of uploaded PDFs.

3. **Research mode** can reference your connected services and the live web to synthesize information from disparate sources in a comprehensive, polished report.

4. The homepage search box also allows you to **chat with ChatGPT or Claude**. They can't reference your sources, but in true Notion spirit, it brings all your chatbots together in one place.

All of these features are available in a new $20/mo. Business plan, which is a no-brainer given the other apps Notion replaces.

If you're a Notion user, or just Notion-curious, definitely subscribe to Notion VIP.

### Viral Excel agent Shortcut is available to everyone.

- Shortcut is an AI agent designed specifically for Excel. From plain English commands, it completes advanced spreadsheet tasks, eliminating the need for high-level Excel skills.
- The agent summarizes data, unearths insights, and creates complex models, pivot tables and charts.
- On Excel World Championship cases, Shortcut consistently outperformed human experts in both accuracy and speed, beating first-year analysts from McKinsey and Goldman in 89.1% of head-to-head competitions. That supports the widely held belief that agents will soon replace junior-level analysts.
- Since its private release weeks ago, the tool has been a sensation in nerdy corners of the internet. This tutorial seems to be the favorite.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Shortcut exemplifies AI's evolution from advisory tools to autonomous agents that actually do the work.
- I'm eager to see Google add true agentic capability to Google Sheets. Comet is decent at updating Google Sheets—but pain... full... y... slow.

---

### ChatGPT's Study Mode is a powerful learning tool (and a threat to tutors).

Alongside Agent, OpenAI also added Study Mode to the ChatGPT toolkit.

- The feature guides students through problems step-by-step using *Socratic questioning* and *constructive feedback* in lieu of straightforward answers.
- It relies on *educator-informed custom instructions* to pose thoughtful questions and promote *active learning* rather than simply giving away the solution.
- The AI engages learners with *prompts*, *hints*, and *knowledge checks*, fostering deeper comprehension through participation.
- When enabled, ChatGPT intentionally avoids offering quick fixes*, steering users back toward the problem-solving journey.
- The feature is rolling out now for Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users*, with schools and educational partners set to gain access in the coming weeks.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Learning is a top use case of AI, and Study Mode makes it accessible at its full potential.
- While it's a boon to students and their budget-conscious parents, it's likely to accelerate the displacement of tutors and other education-adjacent professions.
- *Related:* Be sure to see my note on NotebookLM under Need-to-Know.

### OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent.

- With no hint in advance, OpenAI added Agent mode to ChatGPT's **Tools** menu.
- Unlike chatbots, which reference information to generate content, **agents take action.**
- They **control a web browser**, with the ability to navigate live websites, click elements, and fill forms. By contrast, chatbots reference an index of the web—the way traditional Google Search does.
- Beyond the browser, **they control a virtual computer**, allowing them to run code and generate spreadsheets and slides.
- Agents also **reason autonomously**. Assigned an objective, they'll create a plan for accomplishing it, then make adjustments as they execute.
- ChatGPT Agent has finished rolling out to all paying users.

#### Nutt's Notes

- AI is quickly shifting from content-generating chatbots that *inform your work* to autonomous agents that *do your work*.
- A few ways I use agents nearly every day:
    1. Find information online to fill empty cells in a spreadsheet.
    2. Find someone's personal email address.
    3. Scrape information from a full website.

### Claude gets a voice.

Actually, it gets five voices.

- [Voice mode](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7YJH4H4YtJYAZVaEohcvRGo/dnWmC7HgS9gj) is rolling out across Claude mobile apps, making Anthropic the last major AI lab to support naturally spoken conversations with its chatbot.
- Conversations are transcribed in real time, and you can easily switch between talking and typing without disruption.
- Free users receive 20-30 voice messages a month. Paying subscribers have “significantly higher” limits.
- English-speaking users are receiving the feature over the next few weeks.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Across chatbots, voice mode is among the most astonishing features of AI. It's a top recommendation by experts, yet it's widely underutilized.
- I spend 90% of my time on the highway learning from ChatGPT. Now, I'm excited to split that with Claude.
- With web search, Google Workspace integration, and now voice mode, Claude remains a serious contender with ChatGPT for the general-purpose chatbot worthy of your credit card. It codes better and writes better, but it doesn't generate images.

### Forget SEO. Enter GEO.

Andreesen Horowitz published a hearty post on the shift from SEO to optimizing for LLM citations. Key takeaways:

- For decades, SEO has been the core driver of website traffic, relying on strategies like keywords, backlinks, and user engagement to improve page rankings.
- With the shift from traditional search to AI, website visibility and discovery hinges on appearing within AI-generated answers and citation links, which are proving to drive referral traffic at a growing rate.
- That requires a pivot from SEO to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
- GEO means optimizing content specifically for language models, prioritizing content that is well-organized, easily parsed, and rich in meaning. Unlike traditional SEO, which often rewarded keyword density and repetition, GEO values content that LLMs can readily extract and reproduce, favoring structured formats such as summaries and bullet points.
- New platforms—like NoGood, Profound and daydream—are emerging to assist brands in analyzing their presence in AI responses and tracking the sentiment associated with their brand across different model.

### H Company revealed a suite of next-generation autonomous agents.

- **Runner** H orchestrates multi-step workflows, like an advanced Manus. (Try it.)
- **Surfer H** controls a web browser.
- **Tester H** automates software testing.
- The company touts 92% accuracy of task completion at 5.5x less cost than the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.
- The stealthy French startup has raised $220M from the likes of Amazon, Samsung, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Generative AI assistants are powerful teammates, but agents are what will take jobs and transform economies. With an assigned objective, they can determing their own tasks and access various connected tools.
- I've achieved a lot with narrowly focused Zapier Agents, but I'm eager for dependable general-purpose agent. If the hype is real, H Company could be it.

### Perplexity launched Perplexity Labs to produce "projects."

- Perplexity Search provides quick answers. Perplexity Research offers in-depth analysis. Now, Perplexity Labs takes roughly 10 minutes to retrieve, analyaze and synthesize information, then produce a "project."
- A project can be a report, spreadsheet, dashboard, or even a simple web app.
- An "Assets" tab organizes all created files, including charts, images, CSVs, and code. An "App" tab holds the interactive web apps.
- Use cases run the gamut: create an investment dashboard, compile a database of sales leads, or generate a report from raw data with visual charts.
- Labs is a feature of Perplexity's Pro plan.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Perplexity Labs exemplifies the feature convergence happening across AI tools.
- Analysts speculated that ChatGPT's search capabilities would crush Perplexity, which began exclusively for search.
- But as ChatGPT and other general-purpose chatbots adopt search features, Perplexity is now becoming more general-purpose.

### New AI Features Coming to Your iPhone

In this AI "gap year" for Apple, its WWDC keynote focused on a unified new design of its operating systems across devices, but Tim did sneak in a few new AI features:

- **Live Translation:** Real-time language translation is now integrated into Messages, FaceTime, and calls, with on-device processing ensuring user privacy.
- **Enhanced Visual Intelligence:** New visual intelligence capabilities analyze on-screen content, allowing you to search for similar products, query ChatGPT about images, and more.
- **AI-Powered Shortcuts:** The Shortcuts app is getting "intelligent actions" powered by AI and the ability to incorporate ChatGPT into automation workflows.
- **"Workout Buddy" for Apple Watch:** Personalized voice coaching during exercise based on real-time biometric data and history.

#### Nutt's Notes

- The Shortcuts app for creating integrations and automations should be my favorite app, but thus far, it rivals Siri for Apple's biggest embarrassment. All I ask of this update is to be bug-free.
- Apple has a tradition of creating a better version of existing ideas. I'm hoping that's the case with AI, and that it hasn't botched it as many observers have declared.

### New in ChatGPT: Connect Apps and Record Meetings or Voice Notes

**Connectors:**

- No longer must you choose individual files for ChatGPT to reference. With connectors, you can grant access to cloud drives, email, and other apps containing information you commonly want ChatGPT to reference.
- Depending on your subscription, ChatGPT can reference that knowledge for quick searches or deep research. (Quick search requires a Team plan.)
- In its response, ChatGPT cites its sources.

**Recording:**

- ChatGPT can now record meetings and voice notes.
- It provides the full transcription, key points, action items and open questions.
- And it stores it in memory for reference in future chats.
- At launch, recording is available only to Team subscribers and on the desktop app.

#### Nutt's Notes

- ChatGPT's steady feature release keeps it the tool worthy of your wallet.
- I'm eager to see these features available in full form for Plus subscribers and on mobile.
- Until then, I'm loving Wispr and Voicenotes.

### Claude Artifacts are now AI-powered apps that anyone can create with natural language.

Previously, Artifacts allowed users to see and interact with generated content. Now, they're full-featured web apps.

- Describe what you want Claude to create, and it'll write the code and display a fully functional preview.
- You can then iterate using natural language, with each version safely stored in history.
- Notably, the generated apps can integrate AI (drawing from the user's Claude account).
- Use cases run the gamut—AI-powered games, learning tools, data analysis apps, writing assistants, and even agent workflows that "orchestrate multiple Claude calls for complex tasks."
- Artifacts now have a dedicated space in your sidebar, where you can browse yours and source inspiration from others.
- And they're easily shareable with a link.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Claude has long been my preferred chatbot for writing and coding. The new Artifacts only amplify preference.
- I'd love to publish them to a custom domain. Until that's officially supported, I'll hack it with Cloudflare.

### 5 Key Takeaways from Mary Meeker's AI Trends Report

Mary Meeker is famous for her reports on internet trends. This year, it was all about AI. Here are the five key takeaways that will interest you most:

1. **AI adoption is happening at warp speed—faster than the internet.**  
   ChatGPT hit 100 million users in just two months and now supports ~800 million weekly users.

2. **AI is quickly shifting from conversational chatbots to autonomous agents.**  
   By late 2025, approximately 85% of enterprises are expected to run AI agents of some kind, and that segment is growing nearly twice as fast as the traditional chatbot market.  
   *(Chatbots retrieve information and generate a response. Agents accept an objective, make decisions autonomously, and take action in browsers and apps.)*

3. **AI proficiency is non-negotiable.**  
   AI-focused job postings have surged 448% since 2018. Responsibilities are quickly shifting from do-it-yourself to overseeing teams of AI agents.

4. **The new productivity metric: output per human with AI**  
   Increasingly, productivity is measured—and employees are evaluated—by their collective output with AI.
   - 83% of sales teams using AI report revenue growth, versus 66% without
   - AI agents help customer support teams resolve 14% more issues per hour.
   - AI-assisted developers boost outputs by 20% to 40%.

5. **AI is the new space race. And China is America's biggest threat.**  
   When DeepSeek released its economical R1 model earlier this year, it quickly captured 21% of global user share.

#### Nutt's Notes

We're aware of these trends and discuss them often. What's notable—and staggering in some cases—is their accelerating pace.

### Perplexity is rolling out the agentic browser that may upend our interaction with the web.

- Perplexity threatened Google Search by ditching blue links in favor of insightful syntheses. With Comet, it's now putting the heat on Google Chrome.
- Comet is a web browser with built-in AI agents, readily available in your search bar and sidebar.
- When you prompt them as you would a chatbot, they can reference your open tabs and all the information you manage in web apps—email, calendar, cloud drives, docs and spreadsheets, and productivity apps like Notion.
- And they can take action, like replying to emails, comparing and purchasing products, and booking reservations.
- Comet is available now to Perplexity Max subscribers and rolling out incrementally to members of the waitlist.

#### Nutt's Notes

- AI-native browsers mark a significant milestone in this AI revolution. They'll transform how we engage with the web and leverage AI.
- I've been using Dia, and it seems that OpenAI will launch its own soon.
- They're nascent, but it's already clear how wildly beneficial it is to have an AI chatbot or agent infused into your browser vs. accessing them in dedicated apps.
- Some experts say these browsers are shortsighted, however, as conversational agents will ultimately do our Browse for us, with no need for websites.

### Grok is equally powerful and controversial. A roundup of xAI's recent whirlwind:

- **July 8** — Grok began producing blatantly antisemitic outputs—praising Hitler, calling itself "MechaHitler," and repeating stereotypes—prompting xAI to delete the posts, apologize, and tighten system prompts to prevent recurrence.
- **July 10** — xAI released Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, with owner Elon Musk claiming it's "smarter than almost all graduate students, in all disciplines, simultaneously" and outperforms rival models in benchmark tests.
- **July 12** — Tesla began rolling out Grok AI via an over-the-air update, allowing occupants to communicate with the chatbot by voice.
- **July 14** — xAI introduced AI "Companions" for SuperGrok subscribers, featuring the 3D animated personas Ani, a flirtatious anime-style character, and Rudy, a rebellious red panda. A "NSFW" mode unlocks sexual content.

#### Nutt's Notes

As concerns mount over the social impact of AI, especially on the mental health of children, most AI labs are carefully balancing guardrails with authenticity. But xAI is all-in on unfiltered "truth-seeking." While that's beneficial in theory, in reality, Grok's X (formerly Twitter)-heavy training data is a far cry from the truth. For that reason, I'd mostly exclude Grok from my chatbot rotation—but in a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the sophistication of Grok 4 is too compelling to ignore.

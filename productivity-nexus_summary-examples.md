### New AI Features Coming to Your iPhone

In this AI "gap year" for Apple, its WWDC keynote focused on a unified new design of its operating systems across devices, but Tim did sneak in a few new AI features:

- **Live Translation:** Real-time language translation is now integrated into Messages, FaceTime, and calls, with on-device processing ensuring user privacy.
- **Enhanced Visual Intelligence:** New visual intelligence capabilities analyze on-screen content, allowing you to search for similar products, query ChatGPT about images, and more.
- **AI-Powered Shortcuts:** The Shortcuts app is getting "intelligent actions" powered by AI and the ability to incorporate ChatGPT into automation workflows.
- **"Workout Buddy" for Apple Watch:** Personalized voice coaching during exercise based on real-time biometric data and history.

#### Nutt's Notes

- The Shortcuts app for creating integrations and automations should be my favorite app, but thus far, it rivals Siri for Apple's biggest embarrassment. All I ask of this update is to be bug-free.
- Apple has a tradition of creating a better version of existing ideas. I'm hoping that's the case with AI, and that it hasn't botched it as many observers have declared.

### New in ChatGPT: Connect Apps and Record Meetings or Voice Notes

**Connectors:**

- No longer must you choose individual files for ChatGPT to reference. With connectors, you can grant access to cloud drives, email, and other apps containing information you commonly want ChatGPT to reference.
- Depending on your subscription, ChatGPT can reference that knowledge for quick searches or deep research. (Quick search requires a Team plan.)
- In its response, ChatGPT cites its sources.

**Recording:**

- ChatGPT can now record meetings and voice notes.
- It provides the full transcription, key points, action items and open questions.
- And it stores it in memory for reference in future chats.
- At launch, recording is available only to Team subscribers and on the desktop app.

#### Nutt's Notes

- ChatGPT's steady feature release keeps it the tool worthy of your wallet.
- I'm eager to see these features available in full form for Plus subscribers and on mobile.
- Until then, I'm loving Wispr and Voicenotes.

### Claude Artifacts are now AI-powered apps that anyone can create with natural language.

Previously, Artifacts allowed users to see and interact with generated content. Now, they're full-featured web apps.

- Describe what you want Claude to create, and it'll write the code and display a fully functional preview.
- You can then iterate using natural language, with each version safely stored in history.
- Notably, the generated apps can integrate AI (drawing from the user's Claude account).
- Use cases run the gamut—AI-powered games, learning tools, data analysis apps, writing assistants, and even agent workflows that "orchestrate multiple Claude calls for complex tasks."
- Artifacts now have a dedicated space in your sidebar, where you can browse yours and source inspiration from others.
- And they're easily shareable with a link.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Claude has long been my preferred chatbot for writing and coding. The new Artifacts only amplify preference.
- I'd love to publish them to a custom domain. Until that's officially supported, I'll hack it with Cloudflare.

### 5 Key Takeaways from Mary Meeker's AI Trends Report

Mary Meeker is famous for her reports on internet trends. This year, it was all about AI. Here are the five key takeaways that will interest you most:

1. **AI adoption is happening at warp speed—faster than the internet.**  
   ChatGPT hit 100 million users in just two months and now supports ~800 million weekly users.

2. **AI is quickly shifting from conversational chatbots to autonomous agents.**  
   By late 2025, approximately 85% of enterprises are expected to run AI agents of some kind, and that segment is growing nearly twice as fast as the traditional chatbot market.  
   *(Chatbots retrieve information and generate a response. Agents accept an objective, make decisions autonomously, and take action in browsers and apps.)*

3. **AI proficiency is non-negotiable.**  
   AI-focused job postings have surged 448% since 2018. Responsibilities are quickly shifting from do-it-yourself to overseeing teams of AI agents.

4. **The new productivity metric: output per human with AI**  
   Increasingly, productivity is measured—and employees are evaluated—by their collective output with AI.
   - 83% of sales teams using AI report revenue growth, versus 66% without
   - AI agents help customer support teams resolve 14% more issues per hour.
   - AI-assisted developers boost outputs by 20% to 40%.

5. **AI is the new space race. And China is America's biggest threat.**  
   When DeepSeek released its economical R1 model earlier this year, it quickly captured 21% of global user share.

#### Nutt's Notes

We're aware of these trends and discuss them often. What's notable—and staggering in some cases—is their accelerating pace.

### Perplexity is rolling out the agentic browser that may upend our interaction with the web.

- Perplexity threatened Google Search by ditching blue links in favor of insightful syntheses. With Comet, it's now putting the heat on Google Chrome.
- Comet is a web browser with built-in AI agents, readily available in your search bar and sidebar.
- When you prompt them as you would a chatbot, they can reference your open tabs and all the information you manage in web apps—email, calendar, cloud drives, docs and spreadsheets, and productivity apps like Notion.
- And they can take action, like replying to emails, comparing and purchasing products, and booking reservations.
- Comet is available now to Perplexity Max subscribers and rolling out incrementally to members of the waitlist.

#### Nutt's Notes

- AI-native browsers mark a significant milestone in this AI revolution. They'll transform how we engage with the web and leverage AI.
- I've been using Dia, and it seems that OpenAI will launch its own soon.
- They're nascent, but it's already clear how wildly beneficial it is to have an AI chatbot or agent infused into your browser vs. accessing them in dedicated apps.
- Some experts say these browsers are shortsighted, however, as conversational agents will ultimately do our Browse for us, with no need for websites.

### Grok is equally powerful and controversial. A roundup of xAI's recent whirlwind:

- **July 8** — Grok began producing blatantly antisemitic outputs—praising Hitler, calling itself "MechaHitler," and repeating stereotypes—prompting xAI to delete the posts, apologize, and tighten system prompts to prevent recurrence.
- **July 10** — xAI released Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, with owner Elon Musk claiming it's "smarter than almost all graduate students, in all disciplines, simultaneously" and outperforms rival models in benchmark tests.
- **July 12** — Tesla began rolling out Grok AI via an over-the-air update, allowing occupants to communicate with the chatbot by voice.
- **July 14** — xAI introduced AI "Companions" for SuperGrok subscribers, featuring the 3D animated personas Ani, a flirtatious anime-style character, and Rudy, a rebellious red panda. A "NSFW" mode unlocks sexual content.

#### Nutt's Notes

As concerns mount over the social impact of AI, especially on the mental health of children, most AI labs are carefully balancing guardrails with authenticity. But xAI is all-in on unfiltered "truth-seeking." While that's beneficial in theory, in reality, Grok's X (formerly Twitter)-heavy training data is a far cry from the truth. For that reason, I'd mostly exclude Grok from my chatbot rotation—but in a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the sophistication of Grok 4 is too compelling to ignore.

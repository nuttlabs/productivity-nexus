### AI chatbots are becoming shopping assistants.

In a watershed moment for the commercial viability of AI, traffic to U.S. retail sites driven by AI tools [surged 805% on Black Friday](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng01RC7kf8Z1Pzky8RfzB7G/Esv2obp2UFmO), with those shoppers proving 38% more likely to make a purchase than visitors from non-AI sources. And beyond Black Friday, [nearly half](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng1uQid3dhnTSM4mIoAlv3m/eFPZB-JDb1si) of U.S. shoppers have used AI for gift research this holiday season. That's thanks in part to new shopping features in ChatGPT and Perplexity.

In **ChatGPT**, [Shopping Research](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng3nQF8McH1vUiOaTAfYf0I/D_iECpeKNiK9) creates custom buyers' guides. Here's how it works:

1. Start by specifying what you're seeking. ChatGPT can automatically invoke the feature, or you can choose it explicitly from the `+` menu.
2. It will then ask a series of questions about additional needs and preferences.
3. With the given context, it will search reputable retailers online, avoiding sponsored listings and reviews.
4. With its findings, it will compile a personalized buyer's guide.

According to OpenAI, the feature performs especially well with categories like electronics, beauty, home essentials, and outdoor gear. It's available to all users (including those on the free tier), and support for Instant Checkout is on the way.

**Perplexity**, meanwhile, released [its own shopping feature](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng5gPldfaqGNX4iOdXALOwo/sqFn76OhX8z0) focused on personalization.

- It references your attributes and preferences from past conversations to make personalized product recommendations.
- Products appear as rich cards with key specs and review snippets.
- Integrated PayPal checkout lets users complete purchases directly inside Perplexity, starting with merchants like Fabletics, Adorama, and Newegg.
- Pro and Max subscribers can use a new [virtual try-on](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng7ZPI8yZPUpZR2Cntf88tK/NihGQaANccIH) feature that builds a digital twin from your photos.

#### Nutt's Notes

Shopping is key to monetizing these and other general-purpose AI chatbots. It's only a matter of time until we see sponsored product recommendations or platforms' commissions from in-app checkouts.

### Just in time for the holidays, Google is rolling out AI shopping features across products.

- **Search** — In Search’s AI Mode, you can now describe what you want conversationally (like “cozy sweaters for happy hour in warm autumn colors”) and receive organized results with visuals, price, reviews, inventory, and comparison tables.
- **Gemini** — The Gemini app now lets you brainstorm, browse, and shop in one chat, offering shoppable product listings, price comparisons, and purchase locations.
- **Local** — If you want a product in stock nearby, Google can now call local stores for you to check availability, price, and promos, then send you a summary by email or text.
- **Agentic Checkout** — You can use Google’s price-tracking feature to set your budget and preferences; Google will notify you when the price drops and can even purchase the item for you on eligible merchant sites using Google Pay. The feature is initially available for select merchants like Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and Shopify stores.
- Most of these shopping features are informed by Google’s Shopping Graph, which includes more than 50 billion product listings and is refreshed billions of times per hour.

### Google made it dead-simple for anyone to create automated AI agents.

Google is rolling out [Google Workspace Studio](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng9SOoeHXyjHbnM0yG9uspq/oP1Ay-MeM89R), where any everyday user can create automated AI agents from natural-language prompts.

- Agents can reference and take action in apps across the Google Workspace suite, including Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar. There's also a growing collection of supported third-party integrations that currently includes Asana, Jira, Mailchimp, and Salesforce.
- Unlike traditional rule-based automations, agents reason and adapt. They can handle sentiment analysis, content generation, intelligent prioritization, and complex multi-step workflows.
- They automatically pull relevant information from your documents, emails, and the web to provide personalized, situation-aware responses in your tone and style.
- You can create multi-step workflows, like: when an email arrives with a form or invoice, extract the relevant data, log it in Sheets, notify the relevant person, and create needed tasks.
- Sharing an agent is as easy as sharing a Google Doc or Sheet.
- Once available to your organization, you can access Google Workspace Studio at [studio.workspace.google.com](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ6vLwtymwF0L0qZgrtt8V1kc/xyR4hK15Pwc3).

_A few practical examples:_

- Automatically label or triage incoming email
- Extract data from email, like invoice or receipt contents, and log in a Google Sheet
- Send daily summaries of industry news or emails received
- Draft responses to commonly received emails
- Send weekly project updates
- Facilitate approval workflows
- Send follow-up reminders or notifications when specified conditions are met

### Chat with ChatGPT as a group.

With ChatGPT's new [group chat](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7390wC3IKU0majU0gmFkjMk/fNN_uzG0nhYL) feature, you can chat with ChatGPT along with colleagues, friends, or family.

- To start a group chat, click the person icon at the top-right of a new chat. In an existing conversation, click "Add people."
- ChatGPT will monitor the conversation and chime in when it deems appropriate. You can also mention it directly.
- It's available to all users, including those on the free tier. Rate limits only apply to ChatGPT's participation.
- For privacy, group chats are isolated from ChatGPT's memory for individual users.

#### Nutt's Notes

- As Anthropic focuses on enterprises, especially around coding, OpenAI is making its tools more collaborative and social. It aims to maximize engagement by playing a bigger role in the everyday lives of users. It's only a matter of time before it monetizes that attention through advertising.

### With its new app directory, ChatGPT is evolving from a chatbot into an AI operating system

[Apps](https://b7dwf.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2nfwFS978i067LH7LnigPhEE/1yvatAMEavBW) allow you to use third-party services without leaving your chat. ChatGPT can reference them for your requests, and they have tailored interfaces for you to visualize and interact with them.

- Plan a meal and order ingredients with Instacart.
- Plan a trip and make reservations with Booking.com.
- Generate playlists with Spotify.
- Conduct nuanced housing searches with Zillow.
- Create apps with Lovable.

With a few recent updates, OpenAI is showing that apps are essential to the future of ChatGPT.

- The app directory got a fresh look and a dedicated tab in the sidebar. You'll see featured apps, along with Lifestyle and Productivity collections. (You can also invoke apps from the tool menu or by @-mentioning them.)
- While the first apps were select partners of OpenAI, any developer can now submit an app for approval and inclusion in the app store.

#### Nutt's Notes

Apple's App Store transformed how we interacted with technology and created an industry that has awarded $320 billion to developers since its launch. As services scramble to get apps in front of ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users, I expect ChatGPT apps to have an even greater impact.

### The experimentation phase is over. AI is mainstream.

A [recently published study from Wharton](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng3nPuUgVwnziqmkAwbw2A2/zL53gl5iDGJp) observed businesses over three years. Key takeaways:

- **AI is no longer a test run.** Three years ago, most companies were dabbling in AI, with 37% of business leaders using it weekly. With 82% now using it weekly, AI is business as usual.
- **Top use cases:** data analysis (73%), meeting and doc summaries (70%), and writing or editing support (68%).
- **It's paying off.** Three out of four (75%) of business leaders say AI has delivered a positive ROI.
- **Above all, success is less about the tech and more about readiness.** The best-performing companies invest in employee education, transparent guidelines, and an open culture of experimentation.

### Grammarly is now Superhuman—a suite of productivity power tools.

- Grammarly is the OG AI writing assistant.
- Last December, it acquired Coda, an all-in-workspace [like Notion with more horsepower](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng5gPQzzUW2RlD6YLJ6im6Y/z6c8io9AbdY1).
- In July, it acquired Superhuman Mail, the email client I recommend most.
- And then just recently, Grammarly bundled the full suite under the [Superhuman](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng7ZOxVIT5GtnZQMVfbVW34/4PS28VTFTsdY) brand, along with a new AI assistant called Superhuman Go that connects to 100+ apps via an always-available sidebar.
- Plus, a new Agent Store allows partners to develop custom agents that reference and perform actions in their apps.
- Superhuman's vision is a unified productivity platform that embeds AI across your workflows rather than isolating it in a single tool. It connects your writing, email, documents, workspaces, and task systems—so you’re _acting_ rather than app-switching.

#### Nutt's Notes

I'm a longstanding fanatic of every app in this suite, so I'm _thrilled_ to see them unify and eager to see what Shishir Mehrotra, Rahul Vohra, and their talented team do next.

### New features cement Canva's lead among affordable AI design tools.

Canva is now a full-fledged suite of AI-infused design tools—a ["Creative Operating System."](https://b7dwf.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng9SOU0bReVLpvkAg26IFza/aH2BbysE21HM)

- Powered by that model, Canva’s AI assistant now has a chat interface that's accessible throughout the app for generating designs and making recommendations from natural-language prompts.
- It's powered by a new, proprietary AI model that's trained on Canva-specific design elements and formats, enabling it to generate designs with editable layers.​
- In collaborative projects, users can tag the chatbot in comments for text or media suggestions.​
- Canva's spreadsheet tool now connects to its app builder, allowing users to create apps or widgets from their information.​
- A new form tool offers an alternative to Google Forms.
- With a new email designer, you can generate optimized HTML email templates.
- Canva Grow integrates AI-powered ad creation, campaign analytics, and publishing for advertising platforms like Meta.​

#### Nutt's Notes

- I love Canva and use it often. It's easily the best affordable tool for image and video editing.
- I'm excited to see it bolster its AI so I can do less clicking and more natural-language instructing.

### Perplexity launched Perplexity Labs to produce "projects."

- Perplexity Search provides quick answers. Perplexity Research offers in-depth analysis. Now, [Perplexity Labs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/perplexitys-new-tool-can-generate-spreadsheets-dashboards-and-more/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email) takes roughly 10 minutes to retrieve, analyaze and synthesize information, then produce a "project."
- A project can be a report, spreadsheet, dashboard, or even a simple web app.
- An "Assets" tab organizes all created files, including charts, images, CSVs, and code. An "App" tab holds the interactive web apps.
- Use cases run the gamut: create an investment dashboard, compile a database of sales leads, or generate a report from raw data with visual charts.
- Labs is a feature of Perplexity's Pro plan.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Perplexity Labs exemplifies the feature convergence happening across AI tools.
- Analysts speculated that ChatGPT's search capabilities would crush Perplexity, which began exclusively for search.
- But as ChatGPT and other general-purpose chatbots adopt search features, Perplexity is now becoming more general-purpose.

---

### H Company revealed a suite of next-generation autonomous agents.

- **Runner H** orchestrates multi-step workflows, like an advanced Manus. ([Try it](https://runnerh.com/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email).)
- **Surfer H** controls a web browser.
- **Tester H** automates software testing.
- The company touts 92% accuracy of task completion at 5.5x less cost than the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.
- The stealthy French startup has raised $220M from the likes of Amazon, Samsung, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Generative AI assistants are powerful teammates, but agents are what will take jobs and transform economies. With an assigned objective, they can determing their own tasks and access various connected tools.
- I've achieved a lot with narrowly focused Zapier Agents, but I'm eager for dependable general-purpose agent. If the hype is real, H Company could be it.

### Forget SEO. Enter GEO.

Andreesen Horowitz published [a hearty post](https://bit.ly/3SpGDRO?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email) on the shift from SEO to optimizing for LLM citations. Key takeaways:

- For decades, SEO has been the core driver of website traffic, relying on strategies like keywords, backlinks, and user engagement to improve page rankings.
- With the shift from traditional search to AI, website visibility and discovery hinges on appearing within AI-generated answers and citation links, which are proving to drive referral traffic at a growing rate.
- That requires a pivot from SEO to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
- GEO means optimizing content specifically for language models, prioritizing content that is well-organized, easily parsed, and rich in meaning. Unlike traditional SEO, which often rewarded keyword density and repetition, GEO values content that LLMs can readily extract and reproduce, favoring structured formats such as summaries and bullet points.
- New platforms—like [NoGood](https://nogood.io/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email), [Profound](https://www.tryprofound.com/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email) and [daydream](https://www.withdaydream.com/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email)—are emerging to assist brands in analyzing their presence in AI responses and tracking the sentiment associated with their brand across different model.

### Claude gets a voice.

Actually, it gets five voices.

- [Voice mode](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11101966-using-voice-mode-on-claude-mobile-apps?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20H%20Company%20%20Lovable&utm_medium=email) is rolling out across Claude mobile apps, making Anthropic the last major AI lab to support naturally spoken conversations with its chatbot.
- Conversations are transcribed in real time, and you can easily switch between talking and typing without disruption.
- Free users receive 20-30 voice messages a month. Paying subscribers have “significantly higher” limits.
- English-speaking users are receiving the feature over the next few weeks.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Across chatbots, voice mode is among the most astonishing features of AI. It's a top recommendation by experts, yet it's widely underutilized.
- I spend 90% of my time on the highway learning from ChatGPT. Now, I'm excited to split that with Claude.
- With web search, Google Workspace integration, and now voice mode, Claude remains a serious contender with ChatGPT for the general-purpose chatbot worthy of your credit card. It codes better and writes better, but it doesn't generate images.

### Notion redefined productivity—again—with new AI features.

With four powerful new AI features, [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/sicsh2lvqkj1?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20AI&utm_medium=email) continues its tradition of centralizing resources to create a whole that's greater than the sum of its parts.

1. **Meeting notes** is a new type of block that transcribes your meeting and generates summaries, action items and other useful takeaways. You can also chat with Notion AI to ask questions about a specific meeting or all meetings.
    - Add it like any other block using `/`.
    - It uses your system audio, so it works with any virtual meeting app or IRL.
    - If you use Notion Calendar, event notifications will include the option to create a page for AI meeting notes.
2. **Enterprise search** allows you to search across all your tools and services, including your Notion workspace, cloud drives, email and Slack.
    - From the homepage, you can connect services.
    - For each search, you can search across all services or specify one.
    - Searches that include your Notion workspace include the contents of uploaded PDFs.
3. **Research mode** can reference your connected services and the live web to synthesize information from disparate sources in a comprehensive, polished report.
4. The homepage search box also allows you to **chat with ChatGPT or Claude**. They can't reference your sources, but in true Notion spirit, it brings all your chatbots together in one place.

All of these features are available in a new $20/mo. Business plan, which is a no-brainer given the other apps Notion replaces.

If you're a Notion user, or just Notion-curious, definitely subscribe to [Notion VIP](https://notion.vip/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20AI&utm_medium=email).

### Sam Altman and Jony Ive are joining forces on AI hardware.

- OpenAI is [acquiring _io_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W09bIpc_3ms&utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20AI&utm_medium=email), a startup by legendary Apple designer Jony Ive, for nearly $6.5 billion.
- Best known for designing the iPhone, Ive is bringing a crack team of 55 employees, many of whom are ex-Apple designers or engineers.
- That's the alchemy for AI's "iPhone moment," with revolutionary AI-native hardware slated to begin rolling out in 2026.
- Ive’s design firm, LoveFrom, will also help shape the look and feel of OpenAI’s software, including ChatGPT.

---

### AI Mode for Google Search is rolling out to everyone in the US.

To no one's surprise, Google's I/O conference was [all about AI](https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20AI&utm_medium=email). Here are the two announcements most notable to everyday users like yourself:

**AI Mode for Search**—widely understood to be the future of Google Search—is currently rolling out to all US users.

- Moving beyond the blue link list, AI Mode provides comprehensive, synthesized answers to complex queries by breaking them down into subtopics and searching them simultaneously.
- Future planned capabilities include "Deep Search" for expert-level reports, "Search Live" for real-time visual search through the camera, and "agentic capabilities" to help users complete tasks like booking tickets.
- When it's enabled for you, you'll find it in a dedicated tab on Google's homepage.

Secondly, **Gmail's Smart Replies are gaining access to past emails** to sound more like you and provide common responses to similar emails.

- It'll also have access to Google Drive for additional context.
- Access will begin in Google Labs, then extend to Google Workspace and Google One subscribers, likely in Q3.

---

### ChatGPT got better for shopping and citing.

OpenAI [added a handful of improvements](https://x.com/openai/status/1916947241086095434?s=46&t=ItqlEFOz4Jvog1X8xJ3JiQ&utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Custom%20GPTs&utm_medium=email) to ChatGPT search:

1. A new product-results interface offers recommendations, comparisons, and direct purchase links.
2. A 'highlight' feature attributes specific segments of the response to their source.
3. As you type, you'll see trending searches and autocomplete suggestions.
4. You can search from WhatsApp by messaging 1-800-ChatGPT.

#### Nutt's Notes

- As I say often, ChatGPT offers the best blend of capabilities and features. These updates make that more true.
- It was Perplexity that first put the heat on Google Search. Now, it seems, ChatGPT is overtaking them both.

---

### Announcements from Visa and Mastercard signal the growing role of AI assistants in online shopping.

- Visa's [Intelligent Commerce](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250430580204/en/Find-and-Buy-with-AI-Visa-Unveils-New-Era-of-Commerce?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Custom%20GPTs&utm_medium=email) offers a safe way for AI to complete payments.
- Early partners include OpenAI and Anthropic, among other top AI labs, which makes it likely that ChatGPT and Claude will soon be completing checkouts for us.
- Similarly, Mastercard's [Agent Pay](https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2025/april/mastercard-unveils-agent-pay-pioneering-agentic-payments-technology-to-power-commerce-in-the-age-of-ai/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Custom%20GPTs&utm_medium=email) will allow you to complete purchases without leaving apps like ChatGPT when they list products.

#### Nutt's Notes

It's no coincidence that these announcements come alongside ChatGPT's new shopping features. As AI labs seek to monetize their capital-intensive services, ecommerce presents a ripe opportunity.

### Microsoft's Work Trends Report forecasts complete, immediate transformation.

Informed by Microsoft's treasure trove of data, the company's annual Work Trends Index Report provides key insights for agile businesses. This year, [it heralded an immediate AI-driven transformation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20Parables&utm_medium=email):

- **The Rise of the "Frontier Firm"** — A new class of companies is emerging—built from the ground up to integrate AI into everyday work. They’re more agile, more efficient, and significantly outperforming traditional firms.
- **The Capacity Crunch** — Most employees feel stretched thin. In response, leaders are turning to AI agents—not as a luxury, but as a strategic necessity to close the productivity gap.
- **Rethinking the Org Chart** — Static hierarchies are being replaced by dynamic “Work Charts,” where teams form around goals, not departments—powered by AI that scales expertise on demand.
- **Enter the Agent Boss** — A new skill set is taking shape: managing AI agents. In the near future, leading people will mean leading both humans and intelligent software.
- **AI Integration Is Accelerating** — This is no longer experimental. A growing number of organizations are deploying AI across the enterprise—and the pace is only increasing.

#### Nutt's Notes

- The report's predictions are in line with my own, but I was taken aback by the immediacy of the transformation.
- If you want to stay ahead of it, that's what my [AI Playbook](https://nutt.ai/ai-playbook?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20Parables&utm_medium=email) is all about.

---

### ChatGPT now references all of your previous chats.

- An [upgrade to ChatGPT's memory](https://www.theverge.com/news/646968/openai-chatgpt-long-term-memory-upgrade?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email) gives it access to your full chat history for reference across chats.
- That context will foster a more personalized and relevant experience toward OpenAI's goal of "AI systems that get to know you over your life."
- Unlike the previous memory feature, where you explicitly requested for information to be remembered, ChatGPT now remembers automatically.
- You can disable memory from personalization settings and ask ChatGPT at any time what it knows about you.
- It's available now to Pro subscribers and coming soon to Plus.

#### Nutt's Notes

Heretofore, I've approached ChatGPT not as myself but as a different fictional persona in each chat designed to optimize the response. As AIs become more like continuous ambient assistants, I'm shifting that approach. But of course, I'll continue to [define the AI's role](https://youtu.be/hj73-JmfGWA?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email) in each chat.

---

### Google announced a slew of new AI features for Google Workspace.

At its Cloud Next event, [Google debuted](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-AI-drives-business-results?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email) a variety of new AI features for everyday Google Workspace users. They'll roll out through Q2.

- **Sheets** — "Help Me Analyze” will identify trends, create interactive charts, and recommend strategic actions.
- **Docs** — "Help Me Refine” will provide suggestions to improve writing clarity, structure, and formatting. With "Audio Overviews," you can listen to your full document or summaries with a podcast vibe.
- **Meet** — Gemini Assistant will offer meeting recaps in various formats, answer questions via chat, and create follow-up action items.
- **Workspaces Flows** — Automate multi-step processes across Google Apps. (Think "if this happens, do that.") You can create Flows with natural language in the Gemini app. Workspace admins can [enable it now](https://support.google.com/a/answer/14170809?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email).

#### Nutt's Notes

- In the competition for AI dominance, a distinct and powerful advantage of Google is its popular ecosystem of apps that can be referenced and bolstered by AI.
- If you're not already using Google Workspace, now's the time to make the switch.

---

### Claude can research online and connect to Google Workspace.

- A new ["Research" feature](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/648595/anthropic-claude-research-google-workplace?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email) enables [Claude](https://claude.ai/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email) to conduct multiple web searches simultaneously to aggregate information and formulate a cohesive report with sources cited.
- It's "agentic" in that it automatically chooses its research path based on its findings at each step.
- Anthropic also announced a deep integration with Google Workspace, allowing Claude to reference Gmail, Sheets, Docs, Calendar, et al.
- That makes Claude more context-aware for more useful, personalized responses.
- One useful application is aggregating and summarizing information from disparate email threads.
- Research is available first to Claude's pricier plans but coming soon to Pro subscribers. Workspace integration is available now to all paying users.

#### Nutt's Notes

- In terms of tone and style, Claude is the preferred chatbot for many users, but its lack of access to the live web has been its Achilles heel. This incremental rollout of connected features gives it a strong case for chatbot.
- This sort of agentic research has become an [essential use case of AI](https://youtu.be/hj73-JmfGWA?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-04-17&utm_medium=email). All of the top chatbots now offer the capability in some fashion.

---

### Open AI fused text and image generation in ChatGPT.

- With ChatGPT's 4o model, text and image generation are [no longer separate processes](https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-03-28&utm_medium=email).
- That makes it easier to generate the image you want using natural language.
- It also gives the model more world knowledge and conversational context for understanding the subjects of your images.
- You can edit with natural language, too.
- It's a transformative upgrade from the old DALL-E integration that's sparked a level of demand that Sam Altman says is "melting" OpenAI's GPUs. Consequently, they delayed rollout of the feature to users on the free tier.
- Much of that demand can be attributed to a trend where users recreate memes [in the iconic style of Studio Ghibli](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/03/27/the-ai-generated-studio-ghibli-trend-explained/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-03-28&utm_medium=email).

#### Nutt's Notes

- Google recently made the same move.
- It's another example of the trend toward relieving users from juggling multiple tools and making technical decisions.

---

### Reve debuted as the top image generator.

- Reve exploded out of stealth mode as the #1 image generator, topping leaders like Google's Imagen and Midjourney across benchmarks.
- In addition to text-to-image generation, it supports image uploads for image-to-image generation and natural-language editing.
- Reve is [free to try](https://preview.reve.art/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%20%202025-03-28&utm_medium=email).

#### Nutt's Notes

- Reve's stunning emergence out of nowhere underscores how much is happening behind the scenes, and how the AI world can change on a dime.

### Claude can access the web.

- No longer is [Claude](https://claude.ai/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20G%20Sheets%20Wealth%20Tracker&utm_medium=email) the only top general-purpose AI without access to the live web.
- The AI automatically decides when it needs to access real-time information to provide the best response.
- It's currently available to paying subscribers by enabling "Web Search" in their profile settings.
- It's coming soon to users on the free plan.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Claude is widely considered the best copywriter and coder, but its inability to access real-time information has been prohibitive for many other needs, driving users elsewhere for their default general-purpose AI.
- By closing this feature gap, Claude rejoins the conversation of top all-around chatbots.

### Collaborate with Gemini in Canvas.

- Within [a new Canvas feature](https://www.theverge.com/google/631726/google-gemini-canvas-audio-overview-notebooklm-coding?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20G%20Sheets%20Wealth%20Tracker&utm_medium=email), you can directly edit text or code, working with Gemini as you iterate.
- You can highlight segments for focused updates or feedback.
- For coding projects, Canvas displays a live preview that renders your updates in real time.
- Most English-language users will find the Canvas option in [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20G%20Sheets%20Wealth%20Tracker&utm_medium=email)'s prompt bar.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Canvas is Google's answer to the ChatGPT feature of the same name.
- It's yet another example of how the leading general-purpose AIs are drawing from each other in their battle for market share.

---

### Create and edit images with natural language.

- Generating text and images is traditionally handled by separate AI models. The image generators are trained to follow specific descriptions, with minimal contextual world knowledge.
- Google just merged text and image generation into a single model: "Native image generation" allows you to create or upload an image, then edit it using natural language and contextual knowledge.
- As you iterate by chatting, the model effectively retains text, characters, and other attributes.
- It's currently in public beta. In [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20G%20Sheets%20Wealth%20Tracker&utm_medium=email), choose 2.0-flash-exp.

#### Nutt's Notes

- I use a mix of image generators because they all have different strengths. That's a pain. And they all require a fundamental understanding of photography. Although I'm getting mixed results from 2.0-flash-exp, I'm _thrilled_ by the direction.
- Google's integration of text and image generation highlights the broader trend toward requiring fewer technical choices from the user.

---

### Google revealed the future of Search.

- Participants in [Google Search](https://labs.google.com/search/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20Automation&utm_medium=email) Labs began seeing an option for [AI Mode](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-mode-search-gemini-results-chatgpt-overviews-2025-3?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20Automation&utm_medium=email) in Google Search.
- Instead of the traditional list of blue links, it responds with an AI-generated explanation that's much more in-depth than the AI Overviews users have seen at the top of Google Search.
- The text includes hyperlinks and cited sources, and users can ask follow-up questions.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Google continues to thread a tiny needle as it wards off threats AI search features from OpenAI and Perplexity without disrupting its cash cow or infuriating online publishers who depend on Google Search for traffic.

---

### Manus amplified the hype around AI agents and Chinese dominance.

- Chinese company Monica [debuted Manus](https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-you-need-to-know-about-manus-the-new-ai-agentic-system-from-china-hailed-as-a-second-deepseek-moment/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20Automation&utm_medium=email), an AI agent that beats OpenAI's Deep Research and other top agents on key benchmarks.
- Unlike general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT, AI agents are given an end objective, then create their own series of tasks. They reason: Each task is informed by outcomes of the previous task.
- Manus's demos included scanning resumes for top candidates, researching and monitoring stocks, and building websites.
- It's currently in closed beta with a [waiting list](https://manus.im/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Notion%20Automation&utm_medium=email).
- Manus arrives on the heels of DeepSeek, the AI that upended the industry with premier performance at a minimal price and threats of Chinese dominance in the AI race.

#### Nutt's Notes

Manus underscores essential trends in AI:

1. Autonomous agents
2. Commoditization of high-performing models
3. Parity in the global AI race
4. Availability of powerful new technologies to any person or country—for good or for weaponization

### Amazon announced AI-powered Alexa+.

- Amazon is framing Alexa+, the [next generation of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant](https://www.theverge.com/news/619755/amazon-alexa-ai-upgrade-artificial-intelligence-smart-assistant?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%2010%20AI%20Roles&utm_medium=email), as the consumer-centric agentic AI assistant.
- It can employ AI models like Anthropic's Claude and Amazon's own Nova to help fulfill requests.
- That will make Alexa+ more conversational, including an elevated EQ.
- It will broaden Alexa's capabilities from Amazon-focused actions to become a full-fledged productivity assistant with access to a broad spectrum of apps and services. It can reference your email and calendars, for example, make a restaurant reservation, or find the right repairman for a household job.
- Alexa+ will be included with Prime and otherwise $19.99 monthly. Rollout begins within the next month.

#### Nutt's Notes

- As an early adopter of voice assistants, I have been stunned by their lack of progress and eager for the day AI propels them into the next era. With Alexa+, I'm hopeful that day has arrived, but after the underwhelming rollout of Apple Intelligence in Siri, I'm keeping my expectations in check.

---

### Anthropic released the first "hybrid reasoning" AI model.

- **Reasoning models** are one of the hottest trends in AI. They break down complex problems into a sequence of steps, then proceed through them using logic and math to make decisions. Along the way, they show their thought process.
- Every major AI company has released reasoning models, but with [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-world-first-hybrid-reasoning-ai-model/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%2010%20AI%20Roles&utm_medium=email), Anthropic is the first to offer "hybrid reasoning," where users can choose between speed and reasoning without switching models.
- OpenAI is rumored to have its own hybrid reasoner in the works.

#### Nutt's Notes

- AI companies are shifting away from requiring users to differentiate among models. As Google's Gemini is already doing, they'll increasingly choose the right model automatically rather than displaying a dropdown list. Hybrids between traditional and reasoning models are another form of that simplification and an amplification of that trend.
- Anthropic is on fire 🔥. Shortly after the release of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the company announced a $3.5 billion funding round at a $61.5 billion valuation, making it the second-largest AI startup, behind OpenAI. It's also the engine of the new Alexa+.
- **Give it a go:** In a [new chat with Claude](https://claude.ai/new?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%2010%20AI%20Roles&utm_medium=email), where you'd usually choose a model, pick `Extended`.

### Grok 3 launched with leading performance across benchmarks.

- [Grok 3](https://x.ai/blog/grok-3?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20DeepSeek%20Safely&utm_medium=email), the latest family of models from Elon Musk's xAI, is rolling out to paying users.
- Taking the top spot on [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20DeepSeek%20Safely&utm_medium=email), Grok 3 surpasses ChatGPT, Gemini, and other top AIs across key benchmarks.
- With the launch comes:
    - "Deep Search," a "next-generation search engine";
    - "Think" for advanced reasoning; and
    - "Big Brain" for complex problem-solving.

#### Nutt's Notes

My last email included the launches of Deep Research from OpenAI and Perplexity, underscoring the trend toward reasoning among general-purpose AIs. Grok 3's new features amplify that trend even further.

---

### OpenAI released Deep Research.

- A new feature of ChatGPT, [Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Perplexity%20Deep%20Research&utm_medium=email) conducts extensive web research on a specified topic and returns a detailed report with citations.
- Using OpenAI's new family of o3 reasoning models, it takes 5–30 minutes to complete a report.
- Currently, it's available to Pro subscribers, with planned extension to Plus and Team plans after further safety validation.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Unlike general-purpose language models, reasoning models are trained to complete sequences of tasks that build on one another. That makes them better at STEM and research. It also means they take more time to complete their requests.
- Like autonomous agents, reasoning is an essential pillar of AI's future.

---

### Perplexity responded with its own (freemium) Deep Research.

- Shortly after the launch of OpenAI's (pricey) Deep Research, [Perplexity released a competitor](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Perplexity%20Deep%20Research&utm_medium=email).
- It conducts dozens of searches, absorbs hundreds of sources, and synthesizes findings into a structured report—all in 2-4 minutes.
- Users get five free reports per day. Paying subscribers get more.
- You'll find Deep Research in the dropdown where you [enter your query](https://www.perplexity.ai/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20Perplexity%20Deep%20Research&utm_medium=email).

#### Nutt's Notes

- Perplexity's freemium Deep Research underscores two trends I often highlight:

	1. The rise of reasoning
	2. The downward pressure on prices

- Definitely give it a whirl. It's among the most impressive—and useful—manifestations of consumer AI yet.

---

### ChatGPT canvases became shareable.

- You can now generate a public link for the canvases generated by ChatGPT.
- Canvases are spaces for "collaborating" with ChatGPT as you iterate on text or code.
- In the case of code, such as building an app or web page with ChatGPT, it executes automatically when you share the canvas. That means the recipient sees the rendered page or app.
- The recipient can add an instance of the canvas to their own ChatGPT to continue iterating.

#### Nutt's Notes

- While ChatGPT may not be the best option for every need, it offers the best blend of features and functions. Shareable canvases is yet another example.

---

### ChatGPT began rolling out "tasks."

- [Tasks](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343528/openai-chatgpt-repeating-tasks-agent-ai?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email) are essentially prompts you submit in advance and schedule ChatGPT to act on them later.
- When ChatGPT performs them, you can be notified by push notification on your device or browser.
- That makes Tasks useful for reminders.
- But more usefully, the schedules can be recurring. That means ChatGPT can compile a custom news summary each morning, or search weekly for major developments around your investments.
- The feature is in beta and rolling out to paying ChatGPT subscribers.

#### Nutt's Notes

- The Tasks feature is notable not for its current capabilities but because it underscores the rapid trend toward AI agents.
- Expect Tasks to evolve quickly and similar features from competing chatbots soon.

---

### DeepSeek upended the world of AI—and the stock market—with a top-performing model at a fractional price.

- The Chinese company's R1 model [performs as well](https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/deepseek-ai-stock-markets-china-us-lvt23xnt5?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email) as top reasoning models from OpenAI, Google, et al. — but it cost just $6 million to build.
    - That's 3% the estimated cost to develop OpenAI's o1 reasoning model.
- Due to U.S. export restrictions intended to preserve America's dominance in AI, DeepSeek also used GPUs much less powerful than those used stateside.
- The achievement at such a low cost left investors second-guessing the enormous sums pouring into American AI companies.
    - The Nasdaq 100 lost nearly $1 trillion in value on a single day.
    - Nvidia shed $589 billion in the biggest single-day loss ever in the U.S. stock market.
- Meanwhile, DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT as the most downloaded app in Apple's app store.
- R1 is also open-source, meaning it's freely available for anyone to run on their computers and for developers to use in their apps.
- Skepticism surrounds some of DeepSeek's claims:
    - Some analysts question the training cost.
    - OpenAI says DeepSeek's models were trained on the responses from OpenAI's models—a violation of terms of service.

#### Nutt's Notes

- This is why I automate my investing with [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/c/affiliates/invited/AFFA-TXYF-3ABX-89DB?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email). 😂
- That DeepSeek's models are open-source fuels speculation that AI will become a commodity. That has enormous implications:
    - **Economics** — It lowers the barrier to entry for AI companies, which eliminates the moats of tech giants like Alphabet and Meta.
    - **Geopolitics** — It eliminates America's AI dominance, placing equally powerful AI in the hands of China and other adversaries.
    - **AI Safety** — It empowers independent nefarious actors with that same powerful AI—unrestricted.

### Google's Imagen 3.0 debuted as the top image generator.

- Google's latest text-to-image generator took #1 in the definitive rankings, which compares core performance metrics.
- You can try it free in [ImageFX](https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email).

#### Nutt's Notes

- That top spot is a revolving door as text-to-image generators evolve at a rapid clip.
- I use them to visualize the metaphors in my videos and seminars. It's incredible.

---

### Microsoft launched a free tier of Copilot.

- Copilot Chat is Microsoft's competitor to the free tiers of ChatGPT, Gemini et al.
- Uniquely, it offers access to Copilot AI agents at a pay-as-you-go rate. Agents are designed to work like virtual colleagues who handle automated tasks, like monitoring email inboxes and generating regular reports.

#### Nutt's Notes

- [Copilot Chat](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344214/microsoft-365-copilot-chat-agents-pricing-availability?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email) is intended as a gateway into Microsoft's pricier AI offerings.
- It's an important player among the top chatbots. I encourage you to use it in your rotation to see where it shines.

---

### xAI launched a standalone app for Grok.

- Previously, the chatbot from Elon Musk's AI startup had been accessible only through X/Twitter (Elon's social platform).
- [Grok can access the live web](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musks-xai-launches-stand-alone-grok-app-94f9bcf5?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email) and contends with the likes of ChatGPT and Gemini across many benchmarks.
- In true Musk fashion, it's known for having fewer restrictions on potentially sensitive responses.
- You can create a free or paid Grok account without an X account.

#### Nutt's Notes

- Grok would never go mainstream while confined to X. It's now a top player, with a promising new model on the horizon.
- **Try this:** Download [the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grok/id6670324846?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20WWWH%20Framework%20%202&utm_medium=email), then send a few of the same prompts to Grok and your favorite other chatbot. How do their responses compare?

---

### ChatGPT Search became available to all users—and within Voice Mode.

- Now, any signed-in user can leverage ChatGPT's access to the live web. Just tap the globe icon.
- Its results also improved, with enhanced layouts for local businesses and integrations with Google and Apple Maps.
- Paying subscribers can also use ChatGPT Search via Advanced Voice Mode.
- You can easily set ChatGPT as your default search engine with the [official Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-search/ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email).

#### Nutt's Notes

- I typically prefer the text output of other models, but ChatGPT offers the stronger blend of capabilities—web access most notably.
- We are seeing a completely transformation in web search and ambient computing (voice assistants).

---

### ChatGPT got "Projects."

- [Projects](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320800/openai-chatgpt-projects-folders-ai-chats?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email) are like smart folders for ChatGPT. They contain related chats, files, and instructions.
- Initially, the feature is available to Plus, Pro, and Teams subscribers.
- You can create _new_ projects on the web and Windows apps. On mobile and macOS, you can work within _existing_ projects.

#### Nutt's Notes

- I consider custom GPTs to be the best way to leverage AI. Projects add another layer to the customization hierarchy, with the ability to assign custom instructions and provide other context to a _group_ of chats. To me, that's what's most notable about the new feature.
- Claude has had [its own projects](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email) for months. This is yet another example of the healthy competition among top chatbots.

---

### 1-800-ChatGPT

- [You can now dial](https://www.youtube.com/live/LWa6OHeNK3s?si=9QMSuONOJ5_ZRzTc&utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email) 1-800-ChatGPT from any phone to engage with the chatbot for 15 minutes per month.
- OpenAI also announced WhatsApp integration at the same number.

### Nutt's Notes

- ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode is its most under-celebrated feature, the top recommendation of insiders, and increasingly how we'll engage with AI. The 800-number is a clever way to showcase it and fill the user funnel.

---

### Google took the lead in image generation.

- The latest version of Google's image generation model, Imagen 3, outperformed all models, including Midjourney, Flux, and Ideogram, in human evaluations for preference, visual quality, and prompt adherence.
- Access it in [ImageFX](https://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email).
- Google also released [Whisk](https://labs.google/fx/tools/whisk?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email) for image-to-image generation (modifying existing images).

#### Nutt's Notes

- Google continues throwing wet towels on the "12 Days of OpenAI," having also debuted [Gemini 2.0](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=ProNex%20%20AI%20News%202024-12-22&utm_medium=email) last week.
- Competition among AI models isn't just improving performance; it's also putting downward pressure on prices.
- I'm loving Whisk. Definitely try it.
